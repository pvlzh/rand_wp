## Random Wallpaper Changer for Windows

rand_wp - application that periodically changes the wallpaper of your Windows desktop to a random image downloaded from the internet.
### Features
* Periodic wallpaper change using a configurable timer
* Random selection of wallpapers by category
* Choosing the desired wallpaper resolution

### Configuration

The .config file is used to customize the behavior of Rand_WP. You can adjust the following settings
* `category` - which category of images would you like to see on your desktop (so far only `landscapes` is available)
* `resolution` - wallpaper resolution (e.g. `1920x1080`)
* `interval` - the frequency (in seconds) between which the desktop background image changes


### The following improvements are planned
1. Expanding the list of categories
2. Optimize image loading and storage
3. Optimization of working with files
4. Porting to linux
